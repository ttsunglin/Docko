This is a tool that helps to collect Autodock vina results 
when screening protein-ligands following the tutorial uploaded

I found it hard to include all the screening data in a CSV file and
time-consuming when I tried to copy all the interested results to Pymol.

This tool provides two functions, first, collect the results of the smallest binding energy of all logfiles;
second, recognize the top(%) results and copy the pdbqt files to the R folder.
